                    <h5>About Me</h5>
                     <p>Thank you for taking the time to visit my about page. My name is Enrico P. Chan a.k.a. "Corine Pkat", a professional Freelance Makeup Artist and Hair Stylist based in Catbalogan City Samar, Philippines. I specialize in Wedding/Bridal Hair and Makeup. I have been doing hair and makeup since 2009.

                        Currently, I work as a full-time on-location makeup artist and hairstylist, I also travel around the country for destination weddings and other events.
                        
                        I received my professional training from the Fashion Institute of the Philippines. I occasionally work as a Guest Makeup Artist for established makeup brands such as M·A·C and Bobbi Brown.
                        
                        With my previous experiences, it never really occurred to me that I would end up making a career out of doing hair and makeup. But for as far as I can remember I have been passionate about great make-up and skincare, both of which can help bring out one’s best features and make a woman look naturally radiant and young-looking.
                        
                        Most of my experience with pageants, fashion shows and theater involved applying makeup and hairstyling which led me to realize that my passion for the art was growing and that was when I made a personal decision to try and make a career out of it which led me to where I am now.
                        
                        MY PHILOSPHY:
                        "I believe that people are naturally beautiful and have made it a mission to help them realize that by enhancing their true beauty.
                        
                        I am a firm believer that everyone is innately beautiful with beauty and nothing gives me more pleasure and joy than helping people recognize that within themselves"<div class=""></div>
